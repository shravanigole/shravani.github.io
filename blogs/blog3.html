    <p>I never thought I’d end up in tech. If you had asked me five years ago what I wanted to do, I’d have probably said something completely different—maybe writing, maybe art, maybe even psychology. But life has a weird way of nudging you towards what you’re meant to do, even if it doesn't look like it at first.</p>

    <p>It all started when I got curious. I remember being fascinated by how websites worked. Clicking buttons, watching animations, filling out forms—it seemed like magic to me. I wanted to know what happened behind the screen. That curiosity slowly turned into Google searches, then YouTube tutorials, and then my first HTML tag.</p>

    <p><strong>The First “Aha!” Moment:</strong> I’ll never forget the first time I wrote code and saw it work. I made a button change colors when I clicked it. Silly? Maybe. But to me, it was like discovering fire. I realized I could build things. Real things. From nothing but an idea and a few lines of code.</p>

    <p>Of course, the journey wasn’t always smooth. There were times I felt completely lost—stuck in tutorials, scared of debugging, intimidated by people who seemed to know everything. But I kept going. I kept building. And over time, I started to believe in myself more.</p>

    <p><strong>Why I Stayed:</strong> What kept me going was the mix of creativity and logic that tech offers. I could design interfaces that looked good, but also make them work smartly. It felt like solving puzzles and telling stories at the same time. And honestly? I was hooked.</p>

    <p>Today, I still feel like I’m learning every single day. I’m not the most experienced coder out there. But I’m passionate, curious, and driven—and that’s enough for now. My unexpected path to tech taught me that it’s okay to start late, to feel lost, to grow slowly. Because what matters most is that you start—and that you keep going.</p>

    <p>To anyone out there who feels like they don’t “belong” in tech—this is your sign. If you’re curious, you belong. Welcome aboard :)</p>
